React always requires a key to be passed to a LIST'S ROOT (i.e. if <div> is returned, then that's the root where a key must be provided). A key is fundamental to React as it allows better performance in terms of recognizing which elements of a list need to be rendered or re-rendered.

NOTE: Check how destructuring is used when mapping over images in ImagesList.js
